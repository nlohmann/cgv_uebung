// In connection with STATEPREDICATE (below), there exist two versions of
// stubborn set. RELAXED selects the Kristensen/Valmari method (Petri net
// conference 2000). Without RELAXED, the Schmidt method (Petri net conference
// 1999) is selected. Kristensen/Valmari behaves significantly better for 
// non-satisfiable predicates while Schmidt tends to approach target states more
// directly if there exist any. Without STUBBORN, or without STATEPREDICATE,
// setting or removing RELAXED does not influence anything.

// When SYMMETRY is defined, the value of SYMMINTEGRATION specifies the

// 2 refers to the iteration of states (leads to maximal reduction.
//	 fast for large symmetry groups, slow for small symmetry griups)
// 3 refers to the canonical representitive technique (does not lead
//   to maximal reduction, fast for all kind of symmetry groups)
// 4 refers to the canonical representitive technique on the fly (i.e.
//   without pre-computed symmetries) (does not lead to maximal reduction)
